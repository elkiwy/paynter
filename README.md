# What is PaYnter?

PaYnter is a Python library that let you procedurally generate images with handy features that you can find in any image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, Krita, etc...


# Features

This is a list with what there is currently inside the code:

- Brushes with:
	- Custom brush tip (B/W png images)
	- Supports for multiple brush tips (randomized each dab)
	- Rotated brush tip
	- Brush spacing

- PaYnter functions:
	- DrawLine


# How to use it

Now it's too early to be usable, but this section will be filled as soon as I can make something fancy with it.


# Dependencies

PaYnter only depends by the **Numpy** and **PIL** modules both of which can be installed with Pip, anything else should come with the python3 bundle.


# Scope 

This project started October 1th 2018 and aims at adding all the image editing software features to be able to create images like these (made with Krita by another my Python script):
