Getting started
===============

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

From Pip
--------

The recommended way to use Paynter is to download it with pip with the command:

..code-block::	
	pip3 install paynter

Also, if you already installed Paynter and you want to upgrade it to the latest release you can do so by running the pip upgrade command:

..code-block::
	pip3 install --upgrade paynter


From Source
-----------

PaYnter can also be used by downloading the source code from the `GitHub <https://github.com/elkiwy/paynter>`_ repository and adding the `paynter` folder inside your project directory.


Usage
^^^^^

After you got Paynter inside your environment, you can use it by simply importing the library inside your main Python script through
    
.. code-block:: python

    #Import the paynter library
    from paynter import *

    #Instantiate your Paynter object
    paynter = Paynter()

    #Unleash your creativity here:




Example.py
^^^^^^^^^^

Since getting used to the objects inside this library can be a bit tricky for coding novices, I made an `Example <https://github.com/elkiwy/paynter/blob/master/example.py>`_ file that covers the basics principles of Paynter.

NB: To be able to use the brushes created by example.py you also need to download the `res` folder where all the used brushtips are stored.
