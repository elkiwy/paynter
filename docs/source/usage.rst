Getting started
===============

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the moment, the project is present only on GitHub, where you can download it and use as a library inside your project.

I'm planning to add it on Pip to be easily installable inside your Python environment.


Usage
^^^^^

After you downloaded the source from GitHub you can use it by simply importing the library inside your main Python script through
    
.. code-block:: python

    #Import the paynter library
    from paynter import *

    #Instantiate your Paynter object
    paynter = Paynter()



Example.py
^^^^^^^^^^

Since getting used to the objects inside this library can be a bit tricky for coding novices, I made an `Example <https://github.com/elkiwy/paynter/blob/master/example.py>`_ file that covers the basics principles of Paynter.
